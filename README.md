# dvhf.js - Data Validation and Handling Framework #

This is a testing repository for the dvhf.js library - currently django app files are provided in this repository, to test the library code.
A separate repository with just the javascript files will be created for those who want to access only the library files, and use in their web apps.
A detailed documentation link will be provided soon.
